// RMT - RASTER Music Tracker Player
// To use this player, you need and ".RMT" file and the corresponding features file.
// The features file is module-specific assembly file that indicates which features
// of the player the module actually uses. Using this file at compile-time, a player
// that is optimized to the requirements of the specific song is created.
// While this help to save memory for a single song, it also creates overhead when
// using multiple songs at once. Because then you need the player also indidivually
// for every song.
// To create a stripped ".RMT" file (with song name and instrument names removed to
// save space) and the features files, use the menu "File / Export As... / ".
// Copy the displayed features definition to the clipboard and paste it into a ".FEAT" file.
// The songs and their feature files are linked as resources using the related ".RC" file.
// See "base\atari\players" folder for implementation details.
