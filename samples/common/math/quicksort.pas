// This algorithm seems pretty fast in performance as its name suggests,
// though it's not easy to implement even if getting the gist of how the sorting algorithm works is not that difficult.

// This sorting algorithm uses recursion extensively, so make sure you are quite familiar with recursion,
// and have used it a lot before trying to understand the algorithm. The quick sort works by using a "pivot".
// The pivot is an index pointer just like the ones used in previous sorting algorithms.
// The purpose of the pivot is to divide the list in two halves, one with elements greater than the pivot and the other
// with elements smaller than the pivot. The pivot is usually chosen to be the left-most element of the list, however
// it is not necessary and one may choose any random element from the list to be the pivot. Up till now, we have got
// the array list divided into two halves. Now, we do the same procedure over this two halves just like we did to the whole
// list - and this is what we call recursion. The longer the list, the more recursion there will be - thus
// more resources are requested i.e. memory space.

// Quick-sort's worst case is when the list is already sorted and choosing the left-most element as the pivot - this will
// obviously be a very lengthy process which turns out to be inefficient for sorting an already sorted list using a quick sort.
// One may think of keeping a state variable which keeps track whether a list is already sorted or not and avoid using
// quick sort to check if an algorithm is sorted or not. Also, if the list to be sorted has got only 1 or less elements, the function returns.
