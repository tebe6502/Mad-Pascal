## Introduction

**Mad-Pascal**  (MP) is a 32-bit **Turbo Pascal** compiler for **Atari XE/XL**. By design, it is compatible with the **Free Pascal Compilator** (FPC) (the `-MDelphi` switch should be active), which means the possibility of obtaining executable code for **XE/XL**, **PC** and every other platform for which **FPC** exists. **MP** is not a port of **FPC**; it has been written based on of **SUB-Pascal** (2009), **XD-Pascal** (2010), the author of which is [Vasiliy Tereshkov](mailto:vtereshkov@mail.ru).

A program that works on Atari might have problems on **PC** if, for example, the pointers have not been initialized with the address of a variable and the program attempts to write to the address `$0000` (memory protection fault). The strengths of **MP** include fast and convenient possibility of inclusion of inline assembly. A program using inline **ASM** does not work on platforms other than **XE/XL**. **MP** uses 64KB of primary memory; `TMemoryStream` provides usage of extended memory.
Variable allocation is static; there is no dynamic memory management. Parameters are passed to functions by value, variable or constant.

The available features are:

* `If` `Case` `For To` `For In` `While` `Repeat` statements
* Compound statements
* `Label` `Goto` statements
* Arithmetic and boolean operators
* Procedures and functions with up to 8 parameters. Returned value of a function is assigned to a predefined `RESULT` variable
* Static local variables
* Primitive data types, all types except the `ShortReal`/`Real` type are compatible. Pointers are dereferenced as pointers to `Word`:
    * `Cardinal` `Word` `Byte` `Boolean`
    * `Integer` `SmallInt` `ShortInt`
    * `Char` `String` `PChar`
    * `Pointer` `File` `Text`
    * `ShortReal` `Real` (fixed-point)
    * `Float16` https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format
    * `Single` https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format
* One-dimensional and Two-dimensional arrays (with zero lower bound) of any primitive type. Arrays are treated as pointers to their origins (like in C) and can be passed to subroutines as parameters
* Predefined type `String` `[N]` which is equivalent to `array [0..N] of Char`
* `Type` aliases.
* `Records`
* `Objects`
* Separate program modules
* Recursion
